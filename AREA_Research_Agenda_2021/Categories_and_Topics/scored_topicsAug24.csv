0,Visualization of Data About or From Tools in AR Display,"Combining live sensor data and tools with AR displays enables many use cases. This topic studies how to meet requirements of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) use cases in new and intuitive ways. In the IIoT, and as part of Industry 4.0, machines and tools run software and may be connected to corporate infrastructure with cables or radios. Frequently, there are consoles on which a user receives tool status and diagnostics. Sensors may be integrated or attached to a tool, thereby enhancing the tool's capability. A tool without direct connection to enterprise IT may be detected with the AR system or paired with a user's AR device. Data from tools (or from a technician's AR system) may be sent to work order management systems, SCADA, and asset tracing and tool use or management systems (e.g., the torque on a screw needs to be increased or decreased).

When an AR-assisted user is controlling connected tools (or interacting with unconnected tools) to perform a task, they do not need to turn their attention away from the main task to receive useful information. However, it is critical that the information provided in AR does not interfere with the user's awareness of the tool and is of value to the user. There is the potential for back-end IIoT systems to contribute to the user's productivity by providing clear indicators of status.

This research topic explores and studies the usability of different approaches to visualize data from or about tools (that may be generated by a user's own device) in an IIoT context. The research could also include making, with AR device pairing, those tools without sensors or that are not connected, more detectable and/or intelligent. The user may also have the ability to receive and to see in their AR display assistance from a remote tool or system expert. The research can also examine integration of data from tools and users' devices with operational software to automatically track processes, apply quality control, and access recommendations for users and managers.

- By immediately visualizing feedback about the status of a tool or process, the user will save time and perform the task or process to criteria the first time. However, the additional information provided must not interfere with performance of tasks and must be compliant with regulations.
- Assessment of technician sentiment toward the AR-connected tools (i.e. do experienced technicians feel they would need this and/or does it affect existing workflow?) could lead to improvements in design or introduction of AR.
- Increased understanding of operational improvements tied to connected tools could improve cost savings analysis and RoI calculations.","An experimental environment using a range of connected or smart tools and procedures will provide the suitable environment for this research.

Users will complete surveys about satisfaction and feedback on various visualizations.",Medium,"This research topic is broad in scope. It can include exploring different approaches to visualize data about tools to better understand and document or compare usability. This would benefit the industry by establishing Industry 4.0 best practices or guidelines. The research could also include making, with AR device pairing, those tools without sensors or that are not connected, more detectable and/or intelligent. This would expand the types and number of existing tools that would be tracked, without the cost of replacing tools that were developed prior to Industry 4.0 adoption. It also can examine integration of data from tools and users' devices with operational software to automatically track processes and provide remote assistance, quality control and recommendations for users and managers. Further, this topic can be combined with studies of AR-enabled guidance, integration of AR with IoT, finding parts and supplies in a large space with AR, 3D user interfaces, live sensor visualization for other use cases, and other use cases in factory or field settings.","Two AREA members with financial support from both industry and government [MxD (in US), the Manufacturing Technology Center (MTC), and the AMRC (in UK)] have the required experimental environments and have already begun studying the approaches in this topic.

1,AR for Material Management and/or Supply Chain Flow with Work Orders,"Many industries track supply chains and juggle limited supplies of components, ingredients, or materials while planning work orders in a system. Combining data with AR displays could provide up-to-date information to users while on the job and assist in distributing human resources according to availability of materials. In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a facility or job site that is nearing the end of materials or has just received a shipment of materials can bring this status information into the AR-assisted user's field of view with updated work orders, reducing delays and optimizing use of resources and distribution of workers.

This topic explores how to better share information about materials, equipment, and tools tracked in operations management software, and, when there are mission critical updates, how to display to a user current information about materials. The user may receive a new work order, be warned about material shortages, or be notified of a new assignment to move materials between locations, for instance. In the latter use case, the user may receive AR-assisted navigation support.

When an AR-assisted user is made aware of status of materials in the supply chain, they are prepared to adapt and feel more satisfied. In addition, there is the potential for back-end IIoT systems to track the user's location before sending instructions with respect to material availabilities.

This research topic explores different approaches to communicating and visualizing levels of materials in an IIoT context to study usability and impacts on worker productivity and satisfaction. It also examines integration of data from connected pallets and packaging and users' devices with operational software to automatically track processes, check in/check out, and make recommendations for users and managers.

- Traditional ERP solutions for supply chain and work order management do not alert users to status updates in their visual field, so while they may provide real-time information, the technician must get information from other sources to act upon the change in status.
- AR systems connected to data processing for parts and supplies on a work site could provide instantaneous status information and guidance, and even navigation, to users.
- By immediately visualizing where materials are to be found and whether they are limited, the system will allow the user to waste less time waiting for materials and allow them to move parts or supplies to their optimal positions.","An experimental environment using a range of manufacturing conditions, materials, and procedures is the suitable environment for this research.

2,Dynamic Distribution of Sensing and Processing Capacity via Body-Area Networks,"Deploying enterprise AR solutions via head-mounted displays is inherently advantageous when simultaneous use of both hands is required. However, currently HMD performance is limited due to technological constraints, such as battery life and heat dissipation needs. One solution is to offload and distribute sensing and processing functions dynamically across other devices worn by the user (smartwatches, exoskeletons, sensing devices etc.)--that is, to a network of external wearable devices and resources.

A network of computing and sensing resources would not only decrease the display processing requirements, it would also enrich data feeds available in a complete AR system. A distributed architecture composed of haptic inputs, auditory signals, vibration and other sensors could provide richer data about the wearer (e.g. pose/posture of different body parts) and the environment. For example, using more diverse sensors could increase the system's ability to detect safety risks before they are clear to the user.

The inputs from more and more varied sensors should be studied for new opportunities. Power savings and a less-heavy headworn display are clear benefits, but the architecture presents many challenges. Having multiple, distributed sources of input or computational functions will require integrating, in real time, separate data streams into a cohesive model. In addition to the user's personal body-worn network, the merging and integration of computational functions could be performed on the edge or in the cloud, leveraging 5G in some cases.

This topic will include in its scope defining and testing different approaches to distributed sensors on the user's body and distributing processing capacity and assessing their impacts if any on device safety, weight, size, power consumption and cost, as well as calculating the utility/benefit ratio of different architectures.

3,Wearable vs Handheld vs Projection: Methods for Quantifying the Impact of AR Modality,"Tablets, mobile phones, and other handheld devices have been widely deployed in enterprise, including among frontline workers who use these devices to access contextually-relevant information while executing work procedures. Although hugely useful, their interaction paradigm forces workers to choose between carrying out the actual steps of a work procedure or interacting with the device. The choices the user makes can also present safety risks.

Commercially available wearable (head-mounted) displays enable frontline workers to consume context-relevant information while executing work procedures using both hands thereby Ã¢Â€Â“ theoretically Ã¢Â€Â“ speeding up work. The same could be true for projection-based AR approaches. And both approaches may decrease or completely mitigate safety risks innate to handheld devices. However, there is no independent assessment of the potential economic or safety benefits of the emerging, AR-enriched hands-free modalities.

This research topic focuses on the development of methodologies for performing objective, quantitative assessments of the impact of wearable and projection-based AR approaches compared to work procedures assisted by AR delivered using handheld devices. Measurement methods would be developed to ensure accuracy with a 95% confidence interval. The assessment methodology could include user acceptance of different modalities.

The research scope could be expanded to include performing comparative studies measuring the exact impact of wearable or projection AR modality vs. the handheld baseline across industries, use cases, and horizontal use case categories.

4,Impact of AR Delivery on People Living in Multidimensional Poverty,"The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) ""measures the complexities of poor people's lives, individually and collectively, each year."" The measure was co-developed between the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative at the University of Oxford and the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme in 2010. It is a key measure for developing countries with regards to progress toward eliminating world poverty. Importantly, this specific measure accounts for many elements of non-monetary poverty to calculate an overall score, composed of three dimensions: health, education, and standard of living. According to the 2020 report ""Charting pathways out of multidimensional poverty: achieving the SDGs,"" ""this is a key moment to study how nonmonetary poverty goes down. It is 10 years before 2030, the due date of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), whose first goal is to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Because AR is a unique information delivery format that is highly conducive to providing increased accessibility to skill acquisition, learning, and even remote healthcare, and given the challenges that COVID has brought into the mix in 2020, UN nations will increasingly be looking for ways to sustain growth and minimize regression with regards to 2030 UN SDG targets. Because education accounts for 1/3 of the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index and this index is measured annually and can be applied flexibly to individuals, this is an ideal opportunity in time to investigate the impacts of AR with regards to reducing world poverty. There is likely to be substantial interest within local governments as well as amongst corporate entities supporting the UN 2030 SDGs.

5,Passthrough vs. See-through: Impacts of Display Technology on Peripheral Vision,"Head-mounted AR displays (HMD) blend simulated reality with the real world while the user uses both hands. Some displays employ a Ã¢Â€Â˜video passthrough' approach (e.g. Oculus Quest), where image processing and graphics rendering blend and display physical and generated reality in real time -- an approach that is used in all handheld AR display systems. Due to technology limitations, video passthrough wearable devices provide a field of view (FoV) between 90 and 120 degrees, thereby limiting the user's peripheral vision.

As peripheral vision is important for user safety, maintaining partial or full peripheral vision is required in many situations. Wearable AR display devices based on optical see-through technology have far lower impact a user's physical world FoV (i.e., they do not interfere with the user's peripheral vision), however, the FoV in which the user perceives digital assets varies.

This research topic focuses on determining the minimum FoV required for wearable video see-through AR display devices to meet workplace safety requirements. The result will provide HMD designers guidance with respect to the minimum FoV (possibly foveated) that must be supported in video see-through in order to provide user experience comparable to the best-in-class optical see-through AR displays.

- Video passthrough displays using existing technologies for graphics overlay on video are less expensive to develop than optical see-through displays.
- AREA members would benefit from having objectively defined measures of the impact of head-worn video see-through displays on the user's peripheral vision.","Studies of human peripheral vision requirements and sensitivities to FoV constraints will need to be performed in highly controlled research conditions. A research platform composed of configurable head-mounted AR display components could be designed. The video passthrough experiences designed for the study will need to have the same level of latency as an optical see-through display and their weight and other ergonomic factors would need to be identical in order to study only the impact of the technology on user's vision. Eye-tracking data could be used to measure the user's gaze and extensive user interviews or other measurement systems would be needed to capture the impacts of the options on eye fatigue, cognition, and task performance.",Near,This research can be combined with or extended to include different wearable form factors including but not limited to monocular displays and binocular or holographic displays.

6,New Power Sources for Wearable AR Displays,"As the complexity and computational requirements of world capture, world analysis, scene management, rendering, and human interactions with AR experiences increase, a delicate balance must be struck so as to ensure that the useful life of a device between recharges is not too low. Power management may be addressed through a combination of different approaches, including increase in use of low power DSPs, off-loading some computational tasks to the edge of the network (off-device services), and increasing power storage capacity. There is another potentially powerful resource to address the duration of wearable AR display usage. This topic focuses on the research and development of novel methods to capture power from the user or the environment that could be transferred to the power storage system.

Specifically, the proposed topic will research, build, and test implementations of new methods of energy harvesting from sources that have not been used in prior wearable AR display systems. There will need to be studies of human movement (steps, arms, hands), solar sources for users that are outdoors, and chemical reactions that release energy. This topic will span a wide range of technologies, including analysis of the power requirements of each individual AR display component.

Introducing or integrating novel power production, transfer, and storage technologies will have impacts on display costs, which could affect the number of devices purchased.","- Most of the leading AR display component and system manufacturers are AREA members.
- Use of wearable AR displays in AREA member settings is limited by many factors, one of which is the size and weight of the display needed in order to store sufficient energy to power the computational processing requirements of AR experiences.
- The issues of power storage to deliver energy for a full work shift can be addressed through reducing local (on-device) processing and power requirements, and increasing storage capacity.
- Having continuously generated power from a source such as the movements or environment of the user is an approach that has not received extensive study but could introduce an attractive alternative to removing a device from use for charging.","The research will be leveraging developments in physics, chemistry, and other sciences pertaining to energy production and combining those with deeper studies of wearable AR display device power use. In addition to theoretical calculations, there will need to be prototypes developed and tested to measure the efficacy and efficiencies of power capture, storage, and use with AR displays. Finally, the introduction of new energy production, transfer, and storage methods or systems will need to be carefully studied for their safety in the workplace.",Long,"This research topic could be studied in different environmental conditions, such as indoors, outdoors, and in different temperatures. In addition, there will need to be studies of different use cases in which some users are actively moving throughout a work shift. The results of this research would also be very valuable for non-enterprise users and display devices.","This field of research is in its infancy, but there are some promising developments such as the electrochemically driven mechanical device developed at MIT and https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10146[revealed in 2016 in Nature].

7,Low Power Digital Signal Processors for Use in AR Display Devices,"While the data about the user's context is captured, fused, and filtered in one digital signal processor (DSP), vision processing units (VPUs) are analyzing individual and fused data signals to detect key features (e.g., objects) of the real world. Audio processing also requires computing resources. At the precise moment when AR experiences are delivered to users, power is needed for the rendering computations. This power usage must not compete with the power necessary for the optics, auditory, or other real time processes to produce digital assets visible to the user.

DSPs are common components of AR Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) in displays. The DSPs accelerate the classes of computational tasks required for optimal performance of AR systems. They can be configured and optimized to specific parameters, matching the sensors that capture the real world tasks that they perform and even the use case or user's requirements.

To reduce total display power usage and increase the time between charges, fundamental research needs to advance the state of the art in design and production of low-power DSPs dedicated to every computationally intensive component of enterprise AR displays and delivery systems.

This research needs to be performed without interference with existing patents and be published and available to component manufacturers and AR display manufacturers without license or fees in order to accelerate the development of new DSPs and to reduce the cost of high-performance enterprise AR display devices and other mobile hardware.

8,AR Visualization of Body Sensors for Worker Biofeedback,"During the performance of tasks or fulfilment of roles, an employee may be unaware of changes in their involuntary bodily functions such as blood pressure and heart rate. When aware of any unusual metrics, the user can choose or be prompted to take appropriate actions. Visual and/or auditory information captured in real time by body-worn sensors (e.g., watches) could capture posture, head flexion and extension, whether the arms are above the shoulders, and possibly even squatting. The system could provide feedback on static posture duration and/or frequency and suggest postural changes or breaks based on criteria that increase the risk of muscular skeletal disorders.

The sensor data can be provided to the AR display through a body-area network. This topic focuses on the low-latency transmission and processing of observations from body-worn sensors to the user's AR display and the presentation of data and recommendations in a compact and actionable manner. The system design research should explore both automated modes (which are triggered upon the user's functions reaching a threshold) as well as manually controlled modes (e.g., enabled by a user seeking to obtain vital statistics). There must also be research to ensure that any AR visualization system is secure and upholds all relevant user data privacy protection policies.

Others must concentrate while working in environmental conditions that are known or anticipated to produce risks to employee well-being (e.g., around vibrations or loud machines). Body-worn sensors can detect abnormal behaviors in the workers' involuntary bodily functions, postures, and use of body parts.
- The implementation of body-worn sensors could be controversial if their ability to protect user data privacy is not clearly demonstrated.
- By using a body-area network and connecting it with their AR display, an employee will be able to see any anomalies in their real time and historical biometrics without distracting them from their task or releasing their personal data.
- With biometric information in their field of view, the AREA employee can modify their behaviors (e.g., reduce stress, change posture, or make other adjustments to manage their body's response to conditions in their workplace).","Research on this topic includes testing and studying the features of body-worn biometric devices in professional settings. It will be necessary to design and build a body-area network supporting existing standards in order to interface with radios and technologies on AR display devices. The research will also require designing and studying the usability, efficacy, and performance of AR-enriched user interfaces for providing a user with only pertinent biometric data via an AR display.",Medium,"This research topic can be combined with other topics pertaining to automated alerting of users to risk conditions using the AR display.

9,Development of Heuristics to Assess Enterprise AR Experience Design and Usability,"Usability heuristics are lists of design guidelines that developers and practitioners can use to evaluate the usability of applications in the design and development process. A heuristic evaluation is an activity conducted by a usability expert that involves a checklist of best practices. Applications are judged on their adherence to the checklist items, and the results are used to refine the application design so that it better meets the end user's needs.

While there are several general usability heuristics available for software interfaces (e.g., NielsenÃ¢Â€Â™s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, SchneidermanÃ¢Â€Â™s Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design), there have been no heuristic checklists developed specifically to assess AR experiences for the workplace. Using a heuristic checklist targeted to enterprise AR reveals aspects beyond the general best practices that are unique to AR environments. This includes characteristics such as safety, comfort, user interaction methods, hardware setup and capabilities, and privacy.

This research topic involves the development of a new heuristic checklist for enterprise AR experience developers and practitioners to use to evaluate the usability of AR experiences and accompanying hardware.

10,Impact of Spatial Vision on Visual Encoding and Memory Anchoring,"Some complex instructions and illustrations used in training or on the job require greater time and cognitive load for workers to understand, retain, and use when displayed in planar mode (2D). Three-dimensional representations and spatial vision enabled by stereoscopy has been shown to increase comprehension of spatially relevant concepts and increases their encoding and retention in memory. Although technology today enables spatial vision, frequently it requires some level of compromise around performance, wearability, or resource requirements.

This research topic focuses on measuring the impact of binocular (vs monocular) vision on short- and long-term memory encoding (i.e., the process of changing sensory inputs into forms that are stored in the brain and anchored in such a way that enables effective retrieval).

For instance, SST measures the speed of electrical activity on the surface of the brain, linking changes in certain areas to specific metrics like engagement and memory encoding. The latter includes eye tracking, facial coding, and biometric data like heart rate monitoring. This research will analyze data for broader interpretation, offering insights into the use and impacts of 3D spatial viewing with AR, compared to measurements made by technology like SST and fMRI.",Near,This research topic can be integrated with fundamental research on brain function.

11,Text Input with AR Head Mounted Displays,"Most AR experiences developed for mixed-reality head-mounted displays require some level of user interaction, such as text input, gestures, or voice input. While voice is the quickest method for a user to control and interact with digital assets, it is prone to error thanks to varying speaking styles, accents, and emotions. It is also not well suited to noisy industrial environments. Text input is typically conducted through hand or finger gestures or a handheld clicker with a virtual QWERTY keyboard. Research examining user performance reveals that both methods are cumbersome, with an average of 5-6 WPM. (For comparison, typical typing speeds on mobile devices range from 30 to 50 WPM.) This performance level is unacceptable for continued and effective use in the workplace. In addition, users may feel fatigued after holding their arm in compromising positions for extended periods of time.

User acceptance and satisfaction is critical and a common struggle among developers of alternate keyboard design, even outside of the HMD/AR domain. The QWERTY keyboard, for example, has been shown to result in slower performance than alternative designs, but the general public is unwilling to relearn a new method.

This research topic involves the study of alternate methods of text input to develop methods with higher performance and user satisfaction. The approaches to be studied include the design of a virtual keyboard and advancing the algorithms behind the keyboard predictive text functionality and user interaction (i.e., tap gesturing vs trace, eye gaze input).

12,Facilitated User Interactions for Selecting and Manipulating 3D Models in AR,"Computer-generated models and models derived from scans of objects are increasingly part of product designs and testing activities. They are also valuable in diagnostics, and guiding assembly, repair and maintenance procedures. Today, many AR experiences use only 2D targets and display 2D line drawings, text, and images. However, in the future 3D models will increasingly be used for object recognition, tracking, and registration of experiences. Models will also be displayed over real-world objects for instructions or ""hanging"" in space when two or more collaborators need to examine the same object. Users will need to manipulate and interact with the models.

Unfortunately, the tools (e.g., pointing devices) and conventions (e.g., gestures and voice commands) for the selection and manipulation of 3D models in AR are unfamiliar and challenging for users. Most models lack clearly labelled anchors, handles, and other indicators that would reduce the barriers to user interactions. When there are multiple models in a scene, users may be unable to select one for closer examination. Users must learn advanced techniques and concentrate to perform simple manipulations such as open, close, and hide, not to mention advanced manipulations such as rotate, scale (enlarge and shrink), attach, move to back, move forward and other actions that may increase the value of a model in AR experiences.

This research topic focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of computer-human interactions and computer graphic techniques to improve the ease-of-use of 3D models in AR experiences. When research results are published in peer-reviewed journals, there will be greater diversity in solutions and more innovation based on a deeper understanding of the options and trade-offs involved.

13,What Factors Influence Perceptions of Presence?,"Presence is a term used to describe the ""feeling of being there"" in a virtual environment. It can be cognitive, in that the user's mind is engaged in the virtual content, or it can be perceptual, in that the user's sensory systems perceive the virtual environment to be ""real."" In Augmented Reality (AR), this is represented by a seamless integration between the physical and virtual worlds.

A question that arises in this area of research is what factors of the virtual environment influence the perceptions of presence? Is there a minimum amount of virtual information needed in an AR environment? Does the level of fidelity of the virtual elements influence the reported experience of presence? For example, will an application that uses realistic 3D models result in higher levels of presence than lower fidelity (i.e., cartoon) 3D models?

In VR worlds, the user is immersed into a completely virtual world, so presence is likely to be experienced if the application is successfully implemented. In AR environments, users are exposed to virtual elements in addition to their physical surroundings. If a user has to switch their attention between the two worlds to complete a task, the result can be disruptive and/or fatiguing due to the lack of presence. If the user can complete the task as if the virtual elements are part of the physical world, the result is a seamless, productive experience that includes presence. It also is possible that lower fidelity serves as a distraction to the user, which may result in breaks in immersion and a reminder of the artifical nature of the virtual world. This could, in turn, impact their sense of presence.

A practical example of this issue is with the use of avatars in collaborative environments. How is presence affected by the appearance and customization of the avatars? If a user pays attention to a particular feature or abnormality due to low fidelity rendering, it may impact their ability to perform the task at hand. Another example may be dynamic elements in the virtual world, such as a bouncing ball or a spinning tire. How distinguishable, in appearance and in behavior, the object is from its physical counterpart may influence the level of reported presence.

The main research question in this area is ""How much virtual information of what fidelity is necessary in an AR environment to produce a sense of presence?"" This question is of interest at both ends of the quantity spectrum -- how much is enough, and how much is too much? Too little and the user will not experience presence; too much and the user may become so immersed in the virtual elements that awareness of the physical world may be compromised.

This research topic involves the examination of AR environments with differing amounts of virtual elements at different levels of fidelity and the measurement of presence among users.

14,Impact of Individual Differences and AR Display Comfort on User Acceptance,"Head-mounted AR display devices are getting lighter and more comfortable. However, users may still perceive the weight on their necks and find the devices cumbersome to don and doff, as well as finding them hot after extended periods of use. Head sizes, head shapes, visual acuity, inter-pupillary distance, and the use of corrective lenses or safety glasses/safety helmets all affect users' comfort and ease of use. While advances in the technology that accommodate wider ranges of users are rapidly being deployed, industry adoption can be hampered by poor user acceptance due to general discomfort.

This research topic examines impacts of individual differences on user satisfaction and acceptance of a variety of HMD devices in the workplace.

15,Visualization of Targets Invisible Due to Atmospheric Conditions,"When conditions prevent mechanical or visual scanning of environments and providing of situational awareness using vision-based technologies, there need to be alternatives. The goal of this research is to provide users (decision makers such as pilots, drivers of cars or vehicles, operators of equipment at night or in blizzard conditions) an accurate visualization of the real-time conditions of a moving machine (e.g., automobile, aircraft, tank, truck) when the surrounding atmosphere is entirely or nearly opaque or the light conditions are not favorable for use of vision-based sensors.

Although identified/scored as an aviation-industry specific topic, the scope of this topic is very broad and results could be applied in many industries (e.g., automotive).

16,Visualization of Temperature Sensor Data in AR for Emergency Response,"The use of thermal imaging data from handheld devices for identification of bodies in smoke-filled spaces has been in use to save lives for decades. This topic is not intended to study that use case. Several companies have successfully integrated the thermal imaging sensors into commercial PPE (""smart helmets"") worn by emergency responders.

This research topic will instead focus on advancing the state of the art of thermal vision. There could be extension of the types and size of thermal imaging technology suitable for including in AR-assisted emergency responses equipment. Currently, thermal imaging produces data in only 2D. Research into visualizing the heat source in 3D will be beneficial. In addition, the research should explore different methods for users to interact with the data displayed on their helmets, new and novel methods of distinguishing between heat-emitting sources detected using thermal imaging and combining the information about a building's floor plan with the thermal imaging to trace safe routes to use when reaching targets under time constraints.

Additional imaging could prevent hazardous interactions. Similarly, when mounted in field equipment, the AR display can alert a driver to the presence of people or animals in the path of the equipment. When the technology is miniaturized and highly reliable, it may be used in enterprise AR use cases including but not limited to medical industry or animal husbandry for diagnostics and therapeutics. If the cost and size of the technologies is sufficiently low, the feature could be used for non-industrial applications, such as in games or education.",#NAME?,"The study of thermal imaging and design of new sensors for heat mapping will involve expertise in physics and engineering.

17,AR for Crop Preservation in Food-Insecure Countries,"Food and nutrition security remains a huge challenge across the globe, particularly as the frequency of extreme climate events increases. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) indicates the level of hunger/starvation present in a particular country or region due to insufficient crop supply. The Food Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FSSA) ""resilience-building thematic mechanism aims to ensure the complementarity of instruments for high-impact aid. It had an indicative budget of Ã¢Â‚Â¬525 million over the 2014-2020 period."" Additionally, ""sustainable food security"" remains a priority for the world economy, with the EU Project Horizon 2020 work programme identifying the following immediate needs for further research and innovation:
- Identification of tools and methods, mainly at the farm level for soil remediation and balanced fertilizers application;  +
- Identification of agricultural system approach that can enhance quality of soils for food production; +
- To raise public awareness about soil as a crucial global resource; +
- Enhance EU-China long-term cooperation in land use optimization for global food and environmental security.

This research topic focuses on how AR can be used to permit farmers to investigate their crops, while layering additional information such as water saturation metrics from IoT data, as well as even potentially an AI component that could categorize types of erosion and/or plant disease and provide real-time feedback with regards to required human intervention. The use of AR in agriculture could be adopted or subsidized by fertilizer corporations, water providers, and other members of an agriculture ecosystem. When those in the field use AR, providers of products and services would be able to connect from a distance and provide real-time advice for farmers and other end-clients.

This study would aim to specifically measure the impact of data-informed AR on crop preservation, particularly in food-insecure countries.

- AR is a unique delivery format that is highly conducive to providing increased accessibility for remote, rural farmers and lowers traditional barriers associated with varying literacy levels, etc.,
- Introduction of AR opens up a myriad of possibilities with regards to establishing and expanding markets.
- There is likely to be substantial interest within local governments as well as amongst corporate entities supporting the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

18,Remote Plant Design and Onboarding with AR,"As research and development centers increasingly focus on implementing scalable industrial solutions on a global scale, it is difficult to ensure that, once new technologies are created and tested in a constrained environment, subject-matter experts can always travel to all the required plant locations.

Remote assistance or collaboration with AR-enhanced local technicians permits subject-matter experts to view a new installation and to support local staff with operation of new technology onsite. Remote experts may advise local users and, where necessary, support specific operational decisions that must be taken rapidly due to the specific site configuration and requirements (e.g. best equipment layout to drive operational efficiency, adjustments due to specific environmental requirements or regulations, etc.).

19,"Cargo Container Loading, Inspection and Management with AR","Containers play an important role in the transportation of goods by sea and air. There are a variety of ways that AR can assist employees to track and manage containers on a vessel, airplane or in port. Where there are risks there are also opportunities. By having information about the status of containers, as well as the weight, shape and type of contents of containers in an AR-ready database, technicians can make better informed decisions.

An example of this is cold chain management. Containers with climate control are used to preserve and to extend and ensure the shelf life of products, such as fresh agricultural produce, frozen food, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products. Depending on the specific product, other physical parameters of the chain may also be regulated, (e.g. CO2/oxygen level, humidity and others).

Cold chain governance requires continuous monitoring and/or RFID tags to document the temperature history down to the container level. If a cold chain breaks, it is paramount to identify effected cargo as such and remove it from further shipping as soon as possible. Head mounted displays, or handheld devices can track unloading cargo and - pulling the data from the containerÃ¢Â€Â™s data logger - visually identify non-compliant containers. This visualization allows for an efficient way of isolating non-compliance or other mismatches.

Stowage is another example. When loading merchant vessels, air cargo, or another shipping instrument, weight distribution is carefully calculated and loading is planned accordingly. These stowage plans are critical to vessel stability therefore compliance is very important. Although stowage or loading plans are delivered by various software tools, execution is dependent on human interaction.

Head mounted displays, handheld devices or stationary cameras can track loading cargo using computer vision, container marking (e.g. QR codes), RFID or other dedicated sensor networks. When loading is finished, cargo distribution can be projected on a digital representation of a vessel. This visualization allows for an efficient way to identify potential non-compliance or other mismatches leading to lower efficiency or risks.

This research topic focuses on documenting use cases for enriching the interactions that AR-enabled technicians, on board, during loading and in port, can have and decisions they may make when receiving and using accurate and up-to-date information about containers and their contents. As the professionals move about within and around containers when loading, inspecting, maintaining or repairing commercial containers, they will be more productive, and security and safety policy compliance can increase.

20,Visualization of Anything of Interest Below Water Surface,"When conditions prevent visual scanning of environments and providing situational awareness using vision-based technologies, there need to be alternatives. The goal of this research is to provide users (decision makers such as operators of any boat or underwater craft) an accurate visualization of the real-time conditions of an operating (moving) machine (e.g., boat, submarine) when the visibility prevents reliable use of vision-based sensors.

Although identified/scored as a marine industry specific project, the scope of this topic is very broad and results could be applied in many industries.

21,Adoption of AR in Metals and Mining Value Chain,"As an industry that has thus far been slower to adapt to automation, mining finds itself at a crossroads with regards to the recent COVID pandemic, in that companies must redesign working environments to accommodate for the a) lack of available on-site skilled labor available to sustain current operations, b) mandates to reduce proximity of individuals, and thus number of crew members on site, and c) retraining and upskilling of current workforce as automation accelerates.

This research topic aims to describe the manner in which employment and crew models can be reconstructed to reduce risk to the overall mining value chain and preserve operational targets so as to prevent wide-scale economic impact to the world economy.

22,Chemical and Radiation Sensors for AR Devices,"Existing AR display devices do not have sensors to detect gases, radiation or other elements in the user's environment. For many use cases of interest to the oil and gas industry as well as, mining, emergency responder and chemical industries, there needs to be research into the types and integration of existing chemical sensing technologies with the AR display or wearable computing system or to develop standard interfaces with IoT sensors to display readings in real time.

This research topic is a concrete example of a more fundamental research topic: the detection of an AR system user's context beyond what can be done with existing sensors (cameras, microphone, IMU, etc).

23,Reconciling Discrepancies between Documented and Actual Locations of Pipeline Networks,"Municipal water systems can be major beneficiaries of Digital Water Services: a combination of source monitoring, production and quality management, leak detection, water balance and network monitoring/modeling and process control. In order to be able to deploy these services at large scale and low cost, the first step is to create a digital representation of the pipeline network. However, documentation of pipeline networks are not always kept up-to-date, or sufficiently precise, therefore, said documentation must be validated or corrected by physical, on-site measurement and documentation.

Largely a manual process of measurement and photographic documentation, this first step represents significant time and human resource investment and is prone to errors. Head-mounted AR displays equipped with camera systems, SLAM (TOFL/LiDAR) and GPS sensors could speed up the process of documenting pipeline networks by performing volumetric capture of the exposed water network assets and interpolating the underground portions. Using the latest camera technologies on AR devices can validate geographic and dimensional data while eliminating or reducing errors.

This research explores the use of AR devices mounted with different camera and SLAM sensory systems using manual measurements as a baseline. The focus is not on end users but on the rapid and accurate capture of data about existing infrastructure.

25,Using 3D and World Mapping Standards to Streamline AR Experience Production,"Creating AR experiences using existing authoring environments is a time-consuming process even for highly-trained developers. One of the greatest hurdles is the specification of real world features to which AR assets are attached/anchored. An alternative to manually defining anchors for AR assets is to adapt the outputs of real world 3D capture systems used in enterprises to be used as anchors for AR.

27,Common APIs for Tracking Libraries for Vision-based AR,"Tracking and registering the position and orientation of the user's camera in real-time is a fundamental functionality for Augmented Reality. For enterprise use cases, the environment cannot always have markers for tracking. There are vision-based tracking libraries using markers and natural feature recognition technologies available as open source libraries as well as under license from commercial sources. In the future, there will likely be many tracking libraries, each optimized for specific contexts and tasks.

When designing AR experiences, developers using existing AR authoring platforms are either forced to use the publisher's own tracking library, or, under the best of circumstances, may choose tracking libraries which will be compiled into the final experience. The developer's choice will depend on the use case requirements. However, when authoring AR experiences, the developer does not have full control or perfect knowledge (for training purposes) of all the environments and features that will be in the user camera's field of view.

As AR experiences become more complex and suitable for use in more environments and circumstances, the AR developer may need to provide (to include or offer) multiple tracking libraries, each suited to the phase of a process or the setting of the user when performing tasks.

This research topic will explore requirements of AR experiences and the attributes of common and future tracking libraries for AR and, based on use cases and requirements, develop one or more application programming interfaces that can be implemented and submitted to an appropriate organization for standardization.

28,Capture and Reporting of Hazardous Incidents in Augmented Reality,"In many industries, corporate, public or industry policies require documenting the circumstances of a hazardous incident and steps taken by an individual or group to reduce or eliminate risks to equipment, employees or others. In order to comply with such policies, it is valuable to have user-worn (user perspective) recording systems automatically triggered and the observations of all sensors encrypted for secure reporting. In some circumstances, a user can self-report incidents by completing an AR-enhanced report form through gestures and auditory commands which are then uploaded and recorded, possibly disseminated to appropriate functions within the organization for corrective actions (Facilities, EHS, etc.)

Alternatively, a constant recording buffer on a user device could be implemented. This could be paired with an artificial intelligence to recognize incidents and/or corrective actions. This may automatically default to an on-premise/centralized or cloud-based management system. For there to be consistent and compliant recording and reporting, AR devices could comply with a capture trigger specification, a capture and encryption protocol and, perhaps, produce reports in standard formats that are acceptable for regulatory and compliance tracing.

This research topic contributes technical requirements and potential solutions to be submitted for standardization in one or more bodies for the purpose of reducing the complexity of integrating AR-assisted automatic incident capture into the IT infrastructure of appropriate authorities.

The topic includes definition of automatic AR-assisted or enabled capture technology types suitable for hazardous incident reporting, resolutions of and compression rates for video and audio, data types to be captured (e.g., location data, temporal parameters, identities of nearby people and other), local and remote security to comply with anti-tampering precautions, and other relevant parameters, regardless of the maker of the AR display devices used.

29,Systems Integration between PLM Systems and AR,"Significant AR experience development effort and time is dedicated to linking domain-specific data to AR engines and presentation systems. While many industries invest in AR scene development, the need is especially high in the manufacturing industry. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software systems curate design, manufacturing, and sustainment information related to a product system (ideally) throughout its entire lifecycle.

Leveraging such data across PLM systems for industrial AR has mainly become a platform-specific exercise. Commercial PLM software vendors provide industrial AR solutions that leverage their application programming interfaces (APIs) to help establish AR scenes. However, most large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) operate in complex, global, and heavily distributed supply chains. In other words, in many cases, OEMs subscribe to every major commercial PLM software platform to handle the variety of data representations provided by their suppliers. This is especially important if the developers aim to truly create a digital twin of a product or production system.

This research topic will develop and test a standard data model that permits the vendor-neutral exchange of AR-critical data to produce updatable, sustainable, and maintainable AR scenes. One particular area of interest is understanding the proper handling of industrial animations.  Though AR standards provide representations for presenting animations within AR scenes, for example, they do not directly relate to product system animations stored within PLM systems. Rather than relying on a particular PLM platform's data representations, if such a data model was successfully developed, software developers would be able to exchange data across PLM software and to platform-agnostic AR engines more readily.

30,Harmonization of Standard Industrial Data with Lightweight 3D Models,"Computer-aided design (CAD) platforms provide a broad suite of tools for constructing highly precise digital three-dimensional (3D) representations of parts, assemblies, and structures. Many engineering teams and organizations adhere to a single CAD platform for formally representing geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) requirements, optimizing design performance through detailed simulations, and developing initial process plans for manufacturing the parts. With the increasing emphasis on model-based engineering across industry, more value is embedded in these digital models every day.

To allow for native 3D models to be displayed on AR modalities, model translation is necessary into more efficient digital models.  Previous work has focused on model tessellation and decimation to make sure that the models are perceptually accurate. Inherently, there is a loss in geometry and topology precision in the translation process.  However, for most AR use cases, there is no need for such a high level of accuracy in the presentation of part and assembly geometries. These translation methods do not currently port supporting information, such as GD&T and other Product Manufacturing Information (PMI), in a platform-agnostic manner.

There is a research opportunity for leveraging existing industrial data standards that enable the exchange of part and assembly information with limited loss of information.  One particular use case of interest is dealing with engineering change management.  In theory, model-based engineering facilitates better management of engineering change, as the native CAD model serves as a reference for all product lifecycle functions and processes.  Let's consider assembly animations and their use in a AR-assisted assembly workstation.  If there is a persistent link or pipeline between the native 3D models and animation with the tessellated model to be used in XR, theoretically, the AR-assisted workstation could be agile and updatable based on upstream engineering changes.

Additional work is required in fundamental mappings between standard data representations, both from the domain perspective such as manufacturing and the AR standard community such as glTF animations.  In general, such work has been characterized as standards harmonization.

31,Testing Protocols for AR-assisted Human-Robot Interaction,"In terms of collaborative robotics, the widespread adoption of robots in historically manual manufacturing environments (which are subject to high product turnover, short production runs, and high variability in equipment configurations) is limited by the robotsÃ¢Â€Â™ inability to effectively and safely integrate and interact with the existing human labor.  Instead, so-called collaborative robots are relegated to secluded operations with minimal contact with the workforce.  The robotsÃ¢Â€Â™ inability to communicate with, understand the intention of, and establish a mutual understanding of the environment and situation with human coworkers decreases the robotsÃ¢Â€Â™ usefulness in collaborative teams consisting of both robots and people.  This limitation is driven by both the absence of tools and protocols needed for effectively describing and measuring human-robot interactions, an incomplete collection of metrics for assessing human-robot teaming performance, and insufficient protocols for enabling more intuitive interfacing with robotic tools. These challenges are compoudned when augmented reality technologies are used at the interface between the robotics and human workers.

32,Trade-off and Substitution: Stereoscopic Vision for Spatial Audio,"Stereoscopic vision has long been considered the best type of visualization in terms of matching physical and simulated realities. While stereoscopic vision is the goal, producing a perfect 3D visualization and registration of AR assets is difficult using current technologies. Addressing the shortcomings of current AR displays will be prohibitively high and present a financial barrier to AR adoption in enterprises.

Leveraging advancements in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and audiology, a new class of devices are emerging. Spatially-aware audio transducers can help determine the exact position and posture/pose of the wearer as well as generate a simulated sound field that matches the physical environment. Such systems could be combined with existing vision-centric displays for high fidelity enterprise AR experiences.

The scope of this topic includes measurement of the spatial audio technology resource requirements and impacts of combining visual cues with spatial audio on user performance.

This research topic compares different modalities of biometric identification and classifies them based on accuracy, cost and ease-of-use.

34,Authoritative Information and Source Validation in AR,"In many use cases and network architectures, data requested by and provided to an AR user for an experience is not pre-loaded on the users device. For a variety of reasons and through a range of technologies, information is streaming from the cloud or edge to the AR device in real time. The reverse is also happening. Sensors on an AR user's device are capturing the real world and can send during or after world capture salient features or any combination of data (e.g., point clouds, video, audio, etc) to a safe and high capacity storage resource in the cloud or on the edge. Users may also need to use an AR device to annotate, confirm ground truth or add information about the real world to the cloud-based databases. During data creation (annotation) or transfer, there may be opportunities for agents to insert inaccurate or false information, or for corruption.

Depending on use cases or publishers, the level of confidence about accuracy and authorship of information consumed from or added to a remote source will vary. In enterprise or industrial use cases, details about asset authenticity, ownership or conditions for use must be associated with the AR asset in metadata.

This research topic focuses on development of ontologies, protocols and/or standards to ensure and to  communicate to or between enterprise systems and users in workplaces that data delivered for use in AR experiences is from an authorized source. In parallel, the research will study or develop on-device authentication systems to validate that data which is added to a pooled (cloud-based) data repository during an AR experience (e.g. tagging information and placing information) is authoritative and the source traceable.

35,Automatic Detection and Obfuscation of Facial and/or Personal Data of People in AR User Vicinity,"In or in proximity of an AR-enabled user's workplace, and in the field of view of the AR display's camera, there may be people who have not agreed to (or are not able to grant permission for) their facial features or any personal data to be included in the AR system's live video stream. If the private information of a person is captured without their explicit permission, a company may be held responsible for storing and any future use of the data. To reduce potential liabilities, entities responsible for a workplace will seek to implement a component of an AR display that removes all unrecognized faces from their systems.

This research topic includes using automatic detection of faces in an AR camera's field of view, determining if the detected facial features are among those of people who have granted their permission to be tracked, and if the face does not match any in the database of those who have granted permission, to automatically and continuously obfuscate the features.

- If an employee is using an AR device in the presence of people who have not granted permission for their personal information, including but not limited to facial features, to be stored and used by the company, the company may be exposed to penalties for breaching privacy data protection regulations.

36,Cybersecurity Risk Assessment and Reduction for AR Environments,"Sensitive enterprise or customer data could be exposed to threats from hostile actors when in field of view of AR-enabled cameras, and/or when sent to users' AR device in order to support their task performance. The hostile actors may interfere with transmission of sensitive data, interrupt or distort its presentation to the user in the AR display, or could operate without detection while ""scraping"" enterprise or customer data for other users. Cybersecurity threat identification and assessment, and mitigation measures for those managing the AR displays in a company are critical to integration of AR in mission critical environments and need to be studied.

37,Impact of AR Delivery in Human-Supported Operational Risk Mitigation,"Whilst automation continues to bring efficiency to operational processes and practices and IoT data capabilities increase exponentially, a crucial element around human intervention remains unaddressed. Specifically, as incoming data indicates that an operational process is trending upward or downward and is approaching deviation from set thresholds, are the humans in proximity to this equipment aware and can they proactively take decisions around appropriate actions, consulting additional support human support and/or schematics, flow charts, or other assets, where necessary? In 2018, McKinsey published an informative report on skill shifts, automation, and the future of the workforce, indicating that, while hours spent performing physical, manual, and basic cognitive skills would decrease by 14-15% between the years 2016 and 2030, higher cognitive skills, social and emotional skills, and technological skills would increase by 8, 24, and 55% respectively. This indicates a sharp departure from manual physical intervention and a transition to interaction between environmental data, people, and equipment in nuanced ways that involve rational analysis and resulting action. +

Increasingly, industries are collecting mass amounts of operational data and parameters via IoT dashboards, though there is little guidance that enables the operator of the future to interpret this data and take appropriate action proactively. Deloitte's 2020 Global Human Capital Trends report indicated that high performance organizations are Ã¢Â€Âœevolving from a focus on automating work to replace workers, to augmenting workers with technology to create superjobs, to collaborating with technology to form superteamsÃ¢Â€Â. AR is specifically and ideally positioned to play a large role in this transition process for organizations across the globe.

This study would aim to specifically measure the tangible operational processes proactively improved by human intervention to a process prompted by a connected AR headset, providing data insights, as well as prompting appropriate proactive human behavior to maintain operational parameters/limits. +

38,Opportunities for AR Cloud Technologies in Enterprise,"AR Cloud technologies are emerging as part of a broader, 3D Ã¢Â€Âœspatial computingÃ¢Â€Â trend. Accurate three-dimensional and spatially-anchored models of the real world are being captured using AR devices and proposed for the design of AR-enabled services with high fidelity positioning of users and assets to automatically connect workers with data from enterprise management systems. Proponents of AR Cloud architectures suggest that using these distributed technologies will result in lower total cost of ownership, higher performance and more flexible AR-enabled solutions. With spatial computing, AR users will have higher engagement, seamless collaborative experiences while sharing 3D models, and options for separating static from dynamic parts of the physical world in AR authoring. By securely off-load computational complexity of AR processes to the edge of their networks, AR display devices will be lighter, have lower power requirements and, potentially lower costs.

This research project will focus on definition of requirements and development of prototypes of devices and network technologies that are not tied to any single vendor's device and network offerings. The results will permit enterprises to evaluate and quantify the benefits of distributed AR Cloud architectures without limiting options for multi-vendor networks.

39,Safe and Secure Multi-User Wearable AR Display Management Systems,"Wearable AR displays are expensive to purchase and, once they are tested and configured for AR experiences in the enterprise, they are highly valuable, limited resources. One of the issues AR managers encounter when seeking funding to purchase wearable AR displays is that no single user needs to have the display for all their tasks during a shift. In fact, until many more AR experiences are published and accepted, display devices are in use for only a fraction of a work day.

In principle, different workplace roles could use the same AR display during different parts of a process or a shift, thereby distributing the fixed cost of the hardware across multiple users and procedures, and ensuring that the system is not idle for significant time.

This research topic focuses on development of solutions to address two issues that currently prevent wearable AR displays from serving as multi-user resources. The first challenge is an environmental health and safety issue. Unless procedures for cleaning AR displays are tested and proven to the workforce to be effective and safe for them, employees are uncomfortable using a shared personal device. Sensitivity to this issue is even greater since the emergence of Covid-19.

The second issue that presents a barrier is the extension of mobile device management (MDM) to AR displays. There must be easy-to-use, reliable, effective and secure authentication of users who share wearable AR displays. User authentication, without typing in user names and passwords, is required in order that the user wearing the AR display at any time receive only those work orders and information that match the employee's current work order, level of training and roles on the job site.

The scope of this research straddles two fields that are not easily combined. The two topics could be studied separately.

40,Barriers to Adoption of AR-assisted Inspection for Quality and Compliance,"Real world conditions must be compared with the agreed or defined compliance targets in many industries. In the future, any discrepancies detected through machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms trained on compliant samples, could automatically show those discrepancies to the user in AR view.

Inspection use cases are not as widely implemented as step-by-step instruction delivery (task guidance) remote assistance and training. Companies with AR deployments in other use case categories could increase their ROI on AR investments if they were to expand their support for AR-assisted inspections. Providers of technologies need greater insights into inspection requirements and industries that perform inspections before work continues or, for compliance purposes, require inspections to be documented.

41,"Visualization of Routes, Risks and Transit Time in AR","Efficient navigation between locations is a challenge encountered in many use cases. Routing and guidance to a location is a killer app for smartphones. Using context to help users navigate to their destinations will also be valuable for AR users but more research is needed to integrate real time data in route calculation and further study on user interfaces will also benefit this use case.

Traffic information from smart phone users contributes to calculations of routes for drivers. At a finer grain, real time data from captured video (e.g., on users and their devices) and stationary or mobile sensors could further improve route planning. Route planning could be made more efficient in workplaces and to remote locations. Visualizing routes and transit times in a wearable AR display permits the user to use both hands and avoids the user needing to look away from the objects and possible obstacles in the vicinity.

For example, in factories or warehouses, workers need to avoid moving through zones where robots are operating, where materials they are transporting do not fit through openings or through any space that is secure and requires credentials for entry/exit. Often the professional is expected to travel to a place which is unfamiliar/to which they have never been. Studies that train, with machine learning, algorithms to detect and use real world conditions would be highly beneficial. A professional may avoid unsafe or impassible routes.

When conditions are apt to change between locations or the exact destination is new each time, an automatic, real-time and AR-enabled navigation support technology can ensure the most efficient and safest routes are followed. Visualization in AR removes the need to look at another device for route information. When small incremental improvements in efficiency are compounded over thousands of users, following optimized routes can impact workforce productivity and lower risk.",#NAME?,"Visualizing route, risk and transit time in AR requires use of geospatial positioning and orientation and will build upon existing navigation technologies and extending technologies already in use (e.g., smart phones) in a variety of environmental conditions (e.g., low and bright light).

42,Informing AR Users About Hazards in Proximity,"In many industries, workplaces contain a plethora of hazards. When known or anticipated, hazard management protocols reduce the risks associated with a user's encountering a hazard when performing tasks or fulfilling a work order. However, there are also hazards which, even if made aware of them, the user is untrained to treat or has insufficient time to avoid or deescalate. Alerts can provide the user time to react. On the other hand, there may be hazards that do not require any specific user actions.

Through data collected by user location sensing technologies on devices, and potentially on users' PPE, as well as maps of known hazards, data generated from sensors on stationary or moving machines, and other methods, artificial intelligence algorithms could be used to continuously maintain and monitor a dynamic 3D map of hazards in a user's proximity. The user may be provided the hazard proximity map at intervals or request to visualize hazards in proximity. When the user reaches conditions with respect to the hazard that suggests appropriate actions are needed, an alert on an AR device can spatially anchor the source of risk or hazard in the user's perception (see Automated Alert to Dangerous Settings [[ra-Salert5-dangerosity]]). If and when needed, guidance for risk mitigation can be provided.

43,Operational Risk Categorization/Matrices as an Indicator of AR Impact Potential,"While it is widely believed that the use of AR has vast potential in operational contexts, particularly those in which large amounts of risk are present, it is thus far difficult for senior stakeholders to narrow down operational processes and scenarios that stand to receive the largest benefit from the introduction of AR technology. Being able to clearly define and target specific opportunities for not only significant process improvement, but also tangible reductions in Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) and Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), due to safe and effective operations.  It is quite standard in high-risk, high-compliance industries to operate under what is typically called a Risk Appetite Matrix, which considers risk type, projected impact, and projected likelihood to determine risk appetite and inform specific mitigation strategies. Because this determination is a human one and involves a series of factors, AR may even prove helpful around remote collaboration/guidance to operators as they make these decisions. Furthermore, the assignment of AR as PPE to particular workplace operations prone to higher risk should clearly demonstrate ROI that would warrant scalable and wide-spread adoption worldwide.

- These metrics are carefully scrutinized at the C-Suite level and substantial budget is provided to help sustain/improve these metrics.
- Identification of operational contexts with the lowest risk appetite subsequently identifies specific opportunities for tangible outcomes that may be delivered via AR intervention.
- This, in turn, can result in tangible ROI and scalability that stimulates further investment in the use of AR, and potentially even AR as a PPE mandate, in some operational processes and contexts worldwide.","Utilize existing organizational and/or industry risk appetite matrix to identify operational processes for which intervention is most likely to impact organizational scorecard (medium to significant).

44,Minimum Useful Fidelity of Streamed Large-scale 3D Models over 5G,"Large scale 3D models and point clouds play an important role in many fields ranging from simulation to Product Lifecycle Management to digital twins deployed on a plethora of AR-capable devices. However, due to systems or resource limitations, these models are not always as close to the reality as they purport to be.

Using AR connected to 5G networks, it is possible to stream these models to a device to assist processes performed by human operators or technicians. Generally speaking, the simpler the model (i.e. the lower the fidelity), the less resource is required for streaming. However, if simplification goes too far, utility suffers, possibly preventing the operator from performing the intended task.

The research scope should include comparative studies measuring the exact impact of automatic model and point cloud simplification due to streaming, possibly expressed by the decrease in polygon count vs the time required and error rates achieved in a particular operations. Measurement methods would be developed to ensure accuracy within 5% margin of error.

45,Rapid QA of Forensics and Public Safety 3D Scanning Outputs,"Accurately capturing accident, crime or crash scenes, and other scenes relevant from a Public Safety standpoint is of utmost importance for law enforcement or other government agencies. This tedious and error-prone work has tremendously benefitted from the adoption of laser scanners made by OEMs like Faro, Leica and others.

Deploying laser scanners to capture crime scenes and other relevant real world situations generates a complex point clouds which requires extensive post processing before the final models are constructed Ã¢Â€Â“ a process that takes place offsite after scanning. Therefore, potential errors of over or under scanning - which can significantly deteriorate the quality of the model Ã¢Â€Â“ is difficult to detect on location. This is of particular concern when the use of scanning equipment is not frequent, e.g. a small town police department or large-scale disaster event.

By deploying AR glasses it is possible to track the location of the scanning device and combine it with its effective scanning range at every stage to create a visual representation of the scanning footprint. This could yield an effective Ã¢Â€Âœcoverage mapÃ¢Â€Â visible via smart glasses that would help the operator spot under-scanned areas.
