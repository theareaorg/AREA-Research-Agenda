# Research Topic Write-Ups: Targets for March 11 meeting

On March 4, the team reviewed six of the seven the Frequency Bar Charts in the https://github.com/theareaorg/AREA-Research-Agenda/tree/main/AREA_Research_Agenda_2021/figures[2021 Research Agenda Figures folder] and developed preliminary targets for remaining effort levels in each of the categories.

This document captures the proposed targets (goals) for new research topics to be developed (written) in one week and the categories and groups to which members volunteered to invest of their time and efforts.

This file was updated on March 14.

## Past Member-Proposed Topics
Two past member-proposed topics have been captured:

. Barriers to Adoption of AR for Inspection Use Cases (Use Cases) [DONE]
. 3D Capture Standards to Streamline AR Authoring (Standards) [DONE]

In addition, Christine will write up at least the following past member-proposed topics:

. Common interface to swap out AR tracking libraries (Standards) [DONE]
. Secure Identity and Authentication Management for Shareable (Multi-User) Wearable AR Displays (Displays or Technology-security topic)
. Facilitated User Interactions for Selecting and Manipulating Virtual Models in Augmented Reality (End User)
. Standards for multi-user shared holograms (Standards)

If she has time, Barb could write up:

. User Experience Evaluation of Industrial Augmented Reality Applications

## Business Category

Would be valuable to develop two research topics that target the "Logistics" Group in this Category. No one was assigned these topics.

UPDATE on March 15: The connected shipping container management topic could be a Logistics group example.

## Displays Category

Christine will complete one Display Device Energy Management topic [DONE] and write up one more [DONE].

If he has time, Peter could write up another Display research topic [DONE].

## End User Category

Barb and ERAU team will propose/write up topics pertaining to "Presence" Group, and we have not yet addressed/assigned development of at least 3-4 "User" Group topics. Could this be where one of Jennifer's topics fit?

## Industries Category

Anything in Industrial Equipment or below is fair game. Try to find topics that are unique to the vertical (industry) rather than use cases that are horizontal.

Christine will write up 3 topics in Emergency Response and Government [one is DONE], and one for Marine [DONE]. All marine topics will be reviewed ("sanity checked") by NNS.

Jennifer will write up two topics in Marine, two in Oil and Gas, one on Industrial Equipment and one on Farming. Is there another one in Metals and Mining?

Peter will write up two on in Utilities [DONE](if possible, check with John Simmins) and I'm not sure which other industry he has an affinity for.

## Technology Category

Peter Orban will write up one topic in IoT [DONE], one for security group [DONE], and perhaps one about video over 5G (Verizon).

Jennifer also will write up one topic on IoT.

Christine will write up two topics pertaining to Web services and one other (TBD based on Bill's figures, in the lower frequency groups).

## Use Cases Category

Jennifer Rogers will do Collaboration and Simulation.

Peter Orban will do Smart Cities [DONE].

Christine will write up two topics fitting in the navigation use case group.
