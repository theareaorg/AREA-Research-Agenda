# Visualization of Targets Invisible Due to Atmospheric Conditions

# Description
When conditions prevent mechanical or visual scanning of environments and providing of situational awareness using vision-based technologies, there need to be alternatives. The goal of this research is to provide users (decision makers such as pilots, drivers of cars or vehicles, operators of equipment at night or in blizzard conditions) an accurate visualization of the real-time conditions of a moving machine (e.g., automobile, aircraft, tank, truck) when the surrounding atmosphere is entirely or nearly opaque or the light conditions are not favorable for use of vision-based sensors.

Although identified/scored as an aviation-industry specific topic, the scope of this topic is very broad and results could be applied in many industries (e.g., automotive). The topic spans everything from the use of non-visual sensors (e.g., sonar) for depth to the development of new computer-human interfaces for 3D data visualization.

# Stakeholders
AR experience developers, operators and owners/users of commercial, private or military aircraft

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
- Almost all existing AR products for outdoor situational awareness rely on RGB or RGBD cameras for real-time environment acquisition, yet the visualization of obstacles or other salient features of the physical world in atmospheric conditions unsuitable to vision-based sensors cannot serve as the basis for decision making for users.
- AREA members with use cases in industries that could use AR in environments with low visibility are not currently able to reliably deploy the technology.

# Possible Methodologies
Acquisition and/or development of lightweight and power-efficient infrared sensors that are effective as alternatives to cameras and existing vision-based environmental capture. Testing and development of 3D interaction modes when user's natural vision is impaired. This research topic could explore IR sensors (which measure differences in temperature, also known as "thermal imaging"), as well as new alternatives.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
Medium

# Research Program
This topic of research overlaps with the topic of using AR to visualize any stationary or moving object in low-visibility conditions. The outcomes of this research could also be applied in non-industrial use cases (e.g., skiing or other sports in low visibility-conditions). The same research topic could be combined with study of user interfaces and interaction paradigms for the visually impaired community.

# Miscellaneous Notes
The use of night vision technologies is widespread in the military/defense industry. There have also been studies of the use of AR for https://sciencebusiness.net/network-news/air-traffic-control-improved-augmented-reality[air traffic control].
