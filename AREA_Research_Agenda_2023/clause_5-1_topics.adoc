[[ra-key-concepts-section]]
==== Key Concepts

The following is a summary of the key concepts described by the Core Module. This is not an exhaustive listing of all of the Core concepts. Rather, it is an introduction those concepts which are essential for understanding the role of the Core Module in the CityGML Conceptual Model.

[[city-model-concept]]
<<CityModel-section,*CityModel*>>: (<<ug-city-model-section,Discussion>>) The CityModel class is the root class of every CityGML conceptual model. It's primary purpose is to aggregate CityModelMembers.

NOTE: Each entry includes a link to the corresponding data dictionary (click on the name) and a link to further discussion of the concept (discussion). Furthermore, each concept has an anchor which makes it a potential target of an internal link.

There are many anchors in this file that begin with the letters "ug". Those are from the CityGML Users Guide and will all be modified/removed when the Research Agenda is published.

[[ra-iso-dependencies-section]]
==== ISO Dependencies

NOTE: these classes are commonly used in OGC standards. They were left in the template in case we have a use for them.

CityGML builds on the ISO 19100 family of standards. The applicable standards are identified in <<ISO-in-CityGML-diagram>>. A <<ISO-classes-dd,Data dictionary>> is also included for all of the ISO-defined classes explicitly referenced in the CityGML UML model. These data dictionaries are provided for the convenience of the user. The ISO standards are the normative source.

[[ug-iso-geometry-section]]
*Geometry*

The most common geometry concept found in the CityGML 3.0 Standard is the concept of <<ug-gm_multiprimitive-section,multi-primitives>>. These are homogeneous collections of <<ug-gm_primitive-section,GM_Primitives>> which are aggregated to form a more compex geometry.

<<ug-gm_composite-section,GM_Composites>> are another form of <<ug-gm_primitive-section,GM_Primitive>> collection. These differ from <<ug-gm_multiprimitive-section,GM_MultiPrimitive>> in that the collection can be heterogeneous. It should be  noted that none of the classes in the CityGML 3.0 Standard are decended from <<ug-gm_composite-section,GM_Composites>>. However, the terms "CompositeCurve", "CompositeSurface", and "CompositeSolid" do appear in the text. The `composit` concept can also be seen in the assocation between spaces and surfaces. Therefore, an explanation of `composits` has been included for completeness.

[[ug-gm_primitive-section]]
===== GM_Primitive

GM_Primitive is the abstract root class of the geometric primitives. Its main purpose is to define the basic "boundary" operation that ties the primitives in each dimension together. A geometric primitive (GM_Primitive) is a geometric object that is not decomposed further into other primitives in the system. This includes curves and surfaces, even though they are composed of curve segments and surface patches, respectively. This composition is a strong aggregation: curve segments and surface patches cannot exist outside the context of a primitive.

NOTE Most geometric primitives are decomposable infinitely many times. Adding a centre point to a line may split that line into two separate lines. A new curve drawn across a surface may divide that surface into two parts, each of which is a surface. This is the reason that the normal definition of primitive as "non-decomposable" is not plausible in a geometry model - the only non-decomposable object in geometry is a point.

[[ug-gm_multiprimitive-section]]
===== GM_MultiPrimitive

Any geometric object that is used to describe a feature is a collection of <<ug-gm_primitive-section,geometric primitives>>. A homogeneous collection of geometric primitives may be a multi-primitive (GM_MultiPrimitive). Geometric complexes have additional properties specific to the type of <<ug-gm_primitive-section,geometric primitive>> they aggregate.

[[ug-gm_complex-section]]
===== GM_Complex

A GM_Complex is a set of disjoint geometric primitives (<<ug-gm_primitive-section,GM_Primitive>>) such that the boundary of each primitive can be represented as the union of other geometric primitives within the complex.

Any geometric object that is used to describe a feature is a collection of <<ug-gm_primitive-section,geometric primitives>>. A collection of geometric primitives may be a geometric complex (GM_Complex). Geometric complexes have additional properties such as closure by boundary operations and mutually exclusive component parts.

[[gm_complex-figure,Figure {counter:figure-num}]]
.GM_Complex Context Diagram
image::figures/GM_Complex.png[align="center"]
////

<<ug-gm_primitive-section,GM_Primitive>> and GM_Complex share most semantics, in the meaning of operations, attributes and associations. There is an exception in that a GM_Primitive shall not contain its boundary (except in the trivial case of GM_Point where the boundary is empty), while a GM_Complex shall contain its boundary in all cases. This means that if an instantiated object implements GM_Object operations both as GM_Primitive and as a GM_Complex, the semantics of each set theoretic operation is determined by the its name resolution. Specifically, for a particular object such as GM_CompositeCurve, GM_Primitive::contains (returns FALSE for end points) is different from GM_Complex::contains (returns TRUE for end points). Further, if that object is cast as a GM_Primitive value and as a GM_Complex value, then the two values need not be equal as GM_Objects.

GM_Complex aggregates GM_Primitives through the `element` property. Since this is an aggregation, the target GM_Primitive may be associated with more than one GM_Complex.

A GM_Complex object can also have a whole/part relationship with other GM_Complex objects. The `contains` association is used to associate the `superComplex` instance with the `subComplex` instance.

Note that the geometric primitives in the set are mutually exclusive in the sense that no point is interior to more than one primitive.  The set is closed under boundary operations, meaning that for each element in the complex, there is a collection (also a complex) of geometric primitives that represents the boundary of that element.

[[ug-gm_composite-section]]
===== GM_Composite

GM_Composite is a subclass of <<ug-gm_complex-section,GM_Complex>>. Like <<ug-gm_complex-section,GM_Complex>>, it has an association with <<ug-gm_primitive-section,GM_Primitives>>. In this case this is an `composition` association with a `composite` role (GM_Composite) and a `generator` role (GM_Primitive). As with the GM_Complex, the GM_Primitve may be associated with more than one GM_Composite.

[[ug-gm_composite-surface-section]]
===== GM_CompositeSurface

A GM_Composite where the <<ug-gm_primitive-section,GM_Primitives>> is a <<ug-gm_orientable-surface-section,GM_OrientatableSurface>>.

A GM_CompositeSurface is also a subclass of <<ug-gm_primitive-section,GM_Primitives>> is a <<ug-gm_orientable-surface-section,GM_OrientatableSurface>>. One of the few examples of multiple inheritance.

////

[[ug-gm_orientable-surface-section]]
===== GM_OrientatableSurface

GM_OrientableSurface consists of a surface and an orientation inherited from GM_OrientablePrimitive. If the orientation is "+", then the GM_OrientableSurface is a GM_Surface. If the orientation is "-", then the GM_OrientableSurface is a reference to a GM_Surface with an upNormal that reverses the direction for this GM_OrientableSurface, the sense of "the top of the surface" (see 6.4.33.2).

  GM_OrientableSurface:
  {Orientation = "+" implies primitive = self};
  {(Orientation = "-" and TransfiniteSet::contains(p : DirectPosition)) implies (primitive.upNormal(p) = - self.upNormal(p))};

[[ug-gm_composite-curve-section]]
===== GM_CompositeCurve

A GM_CompositeCurve is a list of geometric curves such that the each geometric curve in the set terminates at the start point of the subsequent curve in the list

The `generator` is a GM_OrientableCurve.

A GM_CompositCurve is also a subclass of GM_OrientatableCurve. One of the few examples of multiple inheritance.

[[ug-gm_orientable-curve-section]]
===== GM_OrientatableCurve

GM_OrientableCurve consists of a curve and an orientation inherited from GM_OrientablePrimitive. If the orientation is "+", then the GM_OrientableCurve is a <<ug-gm_curve-section,GM_Curve>>. If the orientation is "-", then the GM_OrientableCurve is related to another <<ug-gm_curve-section,GM_Curve>> with a parameterization that reverses the sense of the curve traversal.

  GM_OrientableCurve:
  {Orientation = "+" implies primitive = self}; +
  {Orientation = "-" implies primitive.parameterization(length()-s) = parameterization(s)};

[[ug-gm_composite-solid-section]]
===== GM_CompositeSolid

A GM_CompositeSolid is a set of geometric solids adjoining one another along common boundary geometric surfaces.

The `generator` is a <<ug-gm_solid-section,GM_Solid>>.

A GM_CompositSolid is also a subclass of <<ug-gm_solid-section,GM_Solid>>. One of the few examples of multiple inheritance.
