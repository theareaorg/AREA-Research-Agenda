=== Overview
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
All AREA Research Agenda topics are listed in the table below. In the Web page for the Research Agenda, the column headings can be used to sort the topics. Once a topic of interest is identified, it can be reached with one click on the topic title.
=======
To support a rapid use and navigation, the AREA Research Agenda topic are sorted in three ways:

- Alphabetically by Title and Categories (the topics are rows and the categories are columns)
- By novelty scores (FindAR similarity rating)
- By Primary Category

In all the tables, every topic can be reached with one click on the topic title.
