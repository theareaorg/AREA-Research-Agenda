# Ensuring proper weight distribution during cargo loading and unloading

# Description
When loading merchant vessels, air cargo, or another shipping instrument, weight distribution is carefully calculated and loading is planned accordingly. These stowage plans are critical to vessel stability therefore compliance is very important. Although stowage or loading plans are delivered by various software tools, execution is dependent on human interaction.
Head mounted displays, handheld devices or stationary cameras can track loading cargo using computer vision, container marking (e.g. QR codes), RFID or other dedicated sensor network and when finished, projected cargo distribution on a digital representation of a vessel. This visualization allows for an efficient way identifying potential non-compliance or other mismatches.
This research topics includes creating digital representations of a cargo vessel and field test of HMD headsets integrated with port and ship maritime systems.
