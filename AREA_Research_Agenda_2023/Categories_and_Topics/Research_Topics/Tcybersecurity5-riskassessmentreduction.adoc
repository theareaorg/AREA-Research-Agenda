# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment and Reduction for AR Environments

## Description
Sensitive enterprise or customer data could be exposed to threats from hostile actors when in field of view of AR-enabled cameras, and/or when sent to users' AR device in order to support their task performance. The hostile actors may interfere with transmission of sensitive data, interrupt or distort its presentation to the user in the AR display, or could operate without detection while "scraping" enterprise or customer data for other users. Cybersecurity threat identification and assessment, and mitigation measures for those managing the AR displays in a company are critical to integration of AR in mission critical environments and need to be studied.

Approaches to reducing risk and increasing resilience of AR display devices can be tested and industry guidelines and best practices published by and for cybersecurity experts. The scope of the research could include comparisons of device vs wireless network security.

## Prior Research

## Key Words
Cybersecurity, risk, encryption, distributed ledger technologies, integration, data interception

### FindAR Terms
network security, security of data, computer crime, computer network security, computer privacy, cryptographic protocols, fraud, intrusion detection, data protection, blockchain, access control

## Research Agenda Categories
Technology, Business

## Stakeholders
Data security officers, employees working in highly sensitive disciplines, customer data protection, employees using AR in the field to access secure databases,

## Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
- Enterprises cannot integrate and deploy technologies that introduce risk to their intellectual property or customer data.
- As long as their data is at risk of exposure, security experts will prevent AR adoption in domains or workplaces where there is uncertainty or risk of exposure.
- Very little is known or documented about possible impacts of the issues around this topic. Studies of enterprise implementations of cybersecurity programs or software in conjunction with AR will increase awareness of issues and reduce risks.

## Possible Methodologies
This project will require laboratory or bench studies with cybersecurity threats into commercial wearable AR displays will highlight vulnerabilities. Tests of commercial or experimental software to manage sensitive data can be conducted in simulated environments. Further, after the tests in simulation, there should be research on the use of the threat mitigation systems in live environments.

## Expected Impact Timeframe
Medium

## Research Program
This topic or theme of research can be combined with assessments of geofencing, biomarkers for user authentication and other methods to reduce risks to enterprise data.

## Miscellaneous Notes
In 2017, this topic was the focus of the first AREA-directed research project. The AREA published the first report on the topic of security for wearable AR displays to members in June 2017 and released the report and assessment protocol to the ecosystem in mid-2019.
