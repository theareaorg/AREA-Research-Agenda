# Dynamic Distribution of Sensing and Processing Capacity via Body-Area Networks

## Description
Deploying enterprise AR solutions via head-mounted displays is inherently advantageous when simultaneous use of both hands is required. However, currently HMD performance is limited due to technological constraints, such as battery life and heat dissipation needs. One solution is to offload and distribute sensing and processing functions dynamically across other devices worn by the user (smartwatches, exoskeletons, sensing devices etc.)--that is, to a network of external wearable devices and resources.

A network of computing and sensing resources would not only decrease the display processing requirements, it would also enrich data feeds available in a complete AR system. A distributed architecture composed of haptic inputs, auditory signals, vibration and other sensors could provide richer data about the wearer (e.g. pose/posture of different body parts) and the environment. For example, using more diverse sensors could increase the system's ability to detect safety risks before they are clear to the user.

The inputs from more and more varied sensors should be studied for new opportunities. Power savings and a less-heavy headworn display are clear benefits, but the architecture presents many challenges. Having multiple, distributed sources of input or computational functions will require integrating, in real time, separate data streams into a cohesive model. In addition to the user's personal body-worn network, the merging and integration of computational functions could be performed on the edge or in the cloud, leveraging 5G in some cases.

This topic will include in its scope defining and testing different approaches to distributed sensors on the user's body and distributing processing capacity and assessing their impacts if any on device safety, weight, size, power consumption and cost, as well as calculating the utility/benefit ratio of different architectures.

## Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
- Employees in AREA member companies frequently need simultaneous use of both their hands. Use of head-mounted displays represents a significant productivity improvement for those who need to use both hands and require contextually-positioned information to perform complex tasks.
- This research topic will contribute new knowledge aimed at addressing current limitations of head-mounted displays and will increase the quality of contextual data about the user and environment.
- The outcomes will reduce the barriers to AR display device integration with other devices and increase use of computational resources on and near the user.
- More flexible and distributed architectures are likely to reduce the HMD price and increase time between battery charges, and these benefits will increase adoption in the enterprise.

## Possible Methodologies
Studies of wearable sensors, low-latency body area network technologies, and sensor fusion processors and their synchronization will be necessary to examine all aspects of this research topic. A research platform composed of configurable head-mounted AR display components could be designed. Sensor data tracing systems may need to be tested or developed to provide a complete understanding of architectural choices.

## Expected Impact Timeframe
Long

## Research Program
This topic is at the intersection of multiple domains including but not limited to sensor configuration and control, sensor registrations, data filtering, sensor fusion, user context capture, and body area networks. The result could contribute to design of new HMD architectures, high-performance, and network-based resources and services (eg., 5G).

## Miscellaneous Notes
Studies of optical and IMU sensor fusion for AR HMDs date have been published as early as 2003. A https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281764749_An_Inertial_and_Optical_Sensor_Fusion_Approach_for_Six_Degree-of-Freedom_Pose_Estimation[recent publication on the topic] of 6DOF pose proves that the approach is very reliable.

The https://illixr.org/[ILLIXR Consortium] is developing a platform which, if extended to include body area networks, could be appropriate for experimentation with different architectures.
