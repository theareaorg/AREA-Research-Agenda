# Impact of Spatial Vision on Visual Encoding and Memory Anchoring

## Description
Some complex instructions and illustrations used in training or on the job require greater time and cognitive load for workers to understand, retain, and use when displayed in planar mode (2D). Three-dimensional representations and spatial vision enabled by stereoscopy has been shown to increase comprehension of spatially relevant concepts and increases their encoding and retention in memory. Although technology today enables spatial vision, frequently it requires some level of compromise around performance, wearability, or resource requirements.

This research topic focuses on measuring the impact of binocular (vs monocular) vision on short- and long-term memory encoding (i.e., the process of changing sensory inputs into forms that are stored in the brain and anchored in such a way that enables effective retrieval).

## Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
- All AREA members seek to reduce cognitive load and increase performance and memory encoding of workers during the performance of complex tasks.
- To date, the role of stereoscopic vision in AR experiences in spatial understanding and memory has not been studied. When these are better understood and the impacts are quantified, designers of experiences and interfaces will be able to accelerate memory anchoring and spatial awareness.
- Determining the specific contributions of AR to human memory and cognitive functions will contribute to calculating return on investment on AR in enterprise, justifying investments and removing enterprise AR adoption barriers.

## Possible Methodologies
The research topic would need experts to develop and use a combination of existing neuro-analytical tools (tools that measure neurological brain activity) and biometric tools that infer neurological responses by proxy. The former includes EEG, fMRI (functional MRI), fNIRS (functional near-infared spectroscopy) and steady state topography (SST), all of which directly measure brain activity related to specific brain functions. For instance, SST measures the speed of electrical activity on the surface of the brain, linking changes in certain areas to specific metrics like engagement and memory encoding. The latter includes eye tracking, facial coding, and biometric data like heart rate monitoring. This research will analyze data for broader interpretation, offering insights into the use and impacts of 3D spatial viewing with AR, compared to measurements made by technology like SST and fMRI.

## Expected Impact Timeframe
Near

## Research Program
This research topic can be integrated with fundamental research on brain function. It could also be combined with studies of specific use cases in which the system recalls the users' spatial vision strategies and enhances those selectively. User experience design would also benefit from studies of this and related neuro-analytical tools and topics.
