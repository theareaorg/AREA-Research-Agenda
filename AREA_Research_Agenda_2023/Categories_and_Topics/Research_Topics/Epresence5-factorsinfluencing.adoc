# What Factors Influence Perceptions of Presence?

## Description
Presence is a term used to describe the "feeling of being there" in a virtual environment. It can be cognitive, in that the user's mind is engaged in the virtual content, or it can be perceptual, in that the user's sensory systems perceive the virtual environment to be "real." In Augmented Reality (AR), this is represented by a seamless integration between the physical and virtual worlds.

A question that arises in this area of research is what factors of the virtual environment influence the perceptions of presence? Is there a minimum amount of virtual information needed in an AR environment? Does the level of fidelity of the virtual elements influence the reported experience of presence? For example, will an application that uses realistic 3D models result in higher levels of presence than lower fidelity (i.e., cartoon) 3D models?

In VR worlds, the user is immersed into a completely virtual world, so presence is likely to be experienced if the application is successfully implemented. In AR environments, users are exposed to virtual elements in addition to their physical surroundings. If a user has to switch their attention between the two worlds to complete a task, the result can be disruptive and/or fatiguing due to the lack of presence. If the user can complete the task as if the virtual elements are part of the physical world, the result is a seamless, productive experience that includes presence. It also is possible that lower fidelity serves as a distraction to the user, which may result in breaks in immersion and a reminder of the artifical nature of the virtual world. This could, in turn, impact their sense of presence.

A practical example of this issue is with the use of avatars in collaborative environments. How is presence affected by the appearance and customization of the avatars? If a user pays attention to a particular feature or abnormality due to low fidelity rendering, it may impact their ability to perform the task at hand. Another example may be dynamic elements in the virtual world, such as a bouncing ball or a spinning tire. How distinguishable, in appearance and in behavior, the object is from its physical counterpart may influence the level of reported presence.

The main research question in this area is "How much virtual information of what fidelity is necessary in an AR environment to produce a sense of presence?" This question is of interest at both ends of the quantity spectrum -- how much is enough, and how much is too much? Too little and the user will not experience presence; too much and the user may become so immersed in the virtual elements that awareness of the physical world may be compromised.

This research topic involves the examination of AR environments with differing amounts of virtual elements at different levels of fidelity and the measurement of presence among users.

## Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
- AREA members will benefit from having new ways to define effective AR application environments from the end user perspective.
- Deeper understanding of presence and when immersion is broken will reduce how frequently an operator must shift their attention, which may cause cognitive tunneling associated with decreased awareness of critical elements in either environment, higher perceptions of mental workload, safety issues, and decreased productivity.
- Understanding the level of fidelity necessary to achieve optimal presence will help AR developers know the appropriate effort and resources to invest in specific use cases.
- The research will also assess if and how impact of fidelity may also be task dependent. For simple assembly tasks, for example, the level of fidelity may matter less than for collaboration tasks where several avatars work together to solve a problem.

## Possible Methodologies
Presence tends to be a self-reported measure assessed by means of a questionnaire. Physiological measures also may be explored to correlate with reported presence, engagement, and satisfaction. These measures could be systematically compared across environments of varying complexity in terms of number of virtual stimuli for a variety of tasks.
