# Testing Protocols for AR-assisted Human-Robot Interaction

## Description
In terms of collaborative robotics, the widespread adoption of robots in historically manual manufacturing environments (which are subject to high product turnover, short production runs, and high variability in equipment configurations) is limited by the robots’ inability to effectively and safely integrate and interact with the existing human labor.  Instead, so-called collaborative robots are relegated to secluded operations with minimal contact with the workforce.  The robots’ inability to communicate with, understand the intention of, and establish a mutual understanding of the environment and situation with human coworkers decreases the robots’ usefulness in collaborative teams consisting of both robots and people.  This limitation is driven by both the absence of tools and protocols needed for effectively describing and measuring human-robot interactions, an incomplete collection of metrics for assessing human-robot teaming performance, and insufficient protocols for enabling more intuitive interfacing with robotic tools. These challenges are compoudned when augmented reality technologies are used at the interface between the robotics and human workers.

This research topic focuses on providing the methods, protocols, and metrics necessary to evaluate the interactive and teaming capabilities of robot systems. It uses a task-driven decomposition of manufacturing processes to assess and assure the safety and effectiveness of human-robot collaborative teams.

## Stakeholders
Manufacturers will benefit from the products generated as a result from this research project.  Robotics providers can also benefit in that standard testing protocols for human-robot interaction will generate new sales tactics. End users will benefit in that the end state will be much safer in complex manufacturing environments.

## Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
- Robotics are pervasive in manufacturing, a key area for many AREA members.
- However, safety concerns in collaborative robotics scenarios have curbed overall use.
- AR-enabled communication between humans and robots can create a much safer environment.

## Possible Methodologies
This collection of methods, protocols, and metrics will enable integrators and end-users to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of collaborative human-robot teams in production processes, impacting both large-scale companies designing and repurposing hybrid manufacturing workflows, and smaller companies looking to begin introducing automated tools into manual processes.

## Expected Impact Timeframe
Long
