# Capture and Reporting of Hazardous Incidents in Augmented Reality

## Description
In many industries, corporate, public or industry policies require documenting the circumstances of a hazardous incident and steps taken by an individual or group to reduce or eliminate risks to equipment, employees or others. In order to comply with such policies, it is valuable to have user-worn (user perspective) recording systems automatically triggered and the observations of all sensors encrypted for secure reporting. In some circumstances, a user can self-report incidents by completing an AR-enhanced report form through gestures and auditory commands which are then uploaded and recorded, possibly disseminated to appropriate functions within the organization for corrective actions (Facilities, EHS, etc.)

Alternatively, a constant recording buffer on a user device could be implemented. This could be paired with an artificial intelligence to recognize incidents and/or corrective actions. This may automatically default to an on-premise/centralized or cloud-based management system. For there to be consistent and compliant recording and reporting, AR devices could comply with a capture trigger specification, a capture and encryption protocol and, perhaps, produce reports in standard formats that are acceptable for regulatory and compliance tracing.

This research topic contributes technical requirements and potential solutions to be submitted for standardization in one or more bodies for the purpose of reducing the complexity of integrating AR-assisted automatic incident capture into the IT infrastructure of appropriate authorities.

The topic includes definition of automatic AR-assisted or enabled capture technology types suitable for hazardous incident reporting, resolutions of and compression rates for video and audio, data types to be captured (e.g., location data, temporal parameters, identities of nearby people and other), local and remote security to comply with anti-tampering precautions, and other relevant parameters, regardless of the maker of the AR display devices used.

## Research Agenda Categories
Standards, Technology

## Stakeholders
Standards bodies, risk managers, safety managers, policy managers, AR developers, IT developers, designers and manufacturers of enterprise AR displays would benefit from there being standards developed in this domain.

## Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
- Some risk sensitive industries and companies require capturing and reporting any incidents that occur in the workplace. Having AR-assisted capture and reporting would reduce cost of compliance.
- AREA members are deploying many different models of AR display devices from numerous display manufacturers. The complexity and cost of integrating hazardous incident capture and reporting technologies with each device in the workplace is prohibitively high.
- A standard with which all devices must comply to be used in workplace settings will increase adoption of AR-assisted capture and reporting of hazardous incidents, increase compliance to policy and reduce cost of implementation of software and integration of AR with enterprise-defined or industry regulated norms.

## Possible Methodologies
The topic requires definition of requirements for automatic, real time, user-perspective, tamper-resistant capture technology that documents situations, user actions and other relevant parameters for compliance purposes. Requirements must then be codified into specifications following industry norms and consensus of group members.

## Expected Impact Timeframe
Medium

## Research Program
This research topic can be combined with industry-specific research projects such as the development of body-worn cameras by law enforcement officers. It can also be an extension to cybersecurity research, research about media encryption and standards pertaining to other methods of incident reporting.

## Miscellaneous Notes
Could be an offshoot of UL8400 or BSI IST/31
