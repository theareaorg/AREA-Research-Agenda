=== AREA Research Agenda - Categories of Research Topic Groups

Categories are the highest level of the AREA Research Agenda organizational structure.

NOTE: Create and insert here a figure showing the three levels of the hierarchy.

==== Definitions
The objective of the category structure is to define research themes of approximately equal importance or value to growth of a strong enterprise AR ecosystem. If and when any category is less well studied than others, it represents a potential need for investment. Although any group in this research agenda is assigned to only one category, it is inaccurate to describe categories as mutually exclusive; some topics could fit in multiple groups, some groups could be included in multiple categories.

The categories for the 2021 edition of the Research Agenda appear in the table below.

^|*Category Name* ^|*Description*
|<<Business-section,*Business*>> |[[business-concept]]Groups of topics about Business Operations and Strategy, Integration with existing business infrastructure, Logistics, Policies.
|<<Displays-section,*Displays*>> |[[displays-concept]]Pertaining to the design, development and use of displays for Augmented Reality experience delivery, including Device Energy Management, Display Technology, Optics, Wearables
|<<End_Users_and_User_Experience-section,*End Users and User Experience*>> |[[end_users_and_user_experience-concept]]All groups of topics about Computer Human Interfaces, Human Factors, Human-Computer Interaction, Presence, Users
|<<Industries-section,*Industries*>> |[[industries-concept]]Twenty industries where studies about the introduction and adoption of Augmented Reality has been published in peer-reviewed literature including Automotive, Aviation and Aerospace, Chemical, Construction, Consumer Products, Cultural Heritage, Education, Emergency Response, Farming and Natural Sciences, Government, Industrial Equipment, Liberal Arts, Manufacturing, Marine, Medical, Metals and Mining, Oil and Gas, Power and Energy, Telecommunications, Transportation, Utilities

/// The above Industries are not 100% aligned with the industries that are provided for the AREA Marketplace project.

All aspects of AR displays must be very efficient in their use of computational resources and power. As their adoption in IoT systems increases, technologies for sensing real-world features have been the focus of public and private research programs. Consequently, techniques to greatly reduce sensor size and power usage are well-known, and costs for these components are dropping. Object recognition, tracking, and registration in real time are other technological barriers that have received considerable research attention, and, increasingly, the AI systems for computer vision are implemented on digital signal processors (DSPs). There remain many other components in AR displays that must be studied in order to follow the same trend as sensors and vision-based simultaneous mapping and location.

While enterprise AR display power storage capacities have in recent years significantly increased, with head-worn computers (e.g., HoloLens2) having greater size and being balanced on the user's head in a more distributed form factor, there remains a great deal of room for improvement in many domains.

NOTE: The above paragraphs could be the introduction for the Display Category research topics.

///

|<<Standards-section,*Standards*>> |[[standards-concept]]Groups of topics about business and technical standards to address interoperability and conventions for AR adoption in enterprises or industries
|<<Technology-section,*Technology*>> |[[Technology-concept]] All engineering domains, including software and hardware for Artificial Intelligence, Audio, Computer Vision, Data, Developers, Engineering, Geospatial, Graphics, Input, IoT, Networks, Robotics, Security, Semiconductors, Sensors, Simulation, Video, Web Services
|<<Use_Cases-section,*Use Cases*>> |[[use_case-concept]]Groups of use cases for enterprise Augmented Reality including Collaboration, Inspection, Safety, and Quality, Maintenance, Navigation, Smart Cities, Training

///NOTE: The AREA Use Cases "catalog" (Marketplace project) has seven additional use cases (not indexed in FindAR above). The Marketplace also includes: Assembly, Guidance, Remote Assistance, Simulation, Situational Awareness, Visualization and Virtual User Interface. Smart Cities is not a use case in the AREA Use Cases Catalog (it is an classified as an industry).///

==== Methodology
The categories were agreed upon by the 8th Research Project team members. Over 2,700 machine-assigned terms ("machine-assigned terms" needs to be linked to the anchor where the machine-assigned terms are described) served as the starting point of the category development process. Machine-assigned terms were manually clustered into 58 groups ("58 groups" needs to be linked to the anchor where the group terms are described). The names of the groups were developed and agreed upon by the team and assignments to groups was made primarily on the basis of reading the abstracts of articles labelled with the same machine-assigned term.

In parallel with the use of machine-assigned terms, member-driven inputs contribute to the structure. Since January 2017, the AREA has been soliciting research topics from its members. Topics have been submitted via a web-based form in five categories which align closely with those used in this edition of the Research Agenda.

Finally, members of the 8th Research Project team also created new groups of potential research topics and new topics based on their experience in the industry.

The source of quantitative data for this research agenda is to be considered (link to the section of documentation about how the topics were identified) as complete as possible. Publications included in the database are from a limited set of editors/publishers and conferences identified by the 8th research project team as relevant to enterprise AR. While every effort has been made to be inclusive, it is assumed that the collection is incomplete, particularly for articles about non-technical topics, such as business.

Every effort will be made to identify and include new sources of articles with machine-assigned terms in the future.   And, Research categories and groups will be reviewed and may be revised and updated when preparing future editions of the AREA Research Agenda.

==== How to Use Categories and Groups
Categories permit researchers and research analysts to quantify the number of recently published peer-reviewed papers and diversity of groups of research topics within a category.

A category containing relatively few groups within it suggests that there is need for increased attention on classifications within groups and research topics within groups. First, it is valuable to explore the namings of groups and their definitions (link "their definitions" to the section with group term definitions). There are groups within a category which are not parallel in concept, or name. Detection of such trends and exploring ways to address these can themselves be the focus of research efforts. Further, many categories are recognized as incomplete. In order to bring value to the ecosystem, leadership of research programs are encouraged consider the reasons for unequal emphasis or depth in a category or group. If there are opportunities for advancement that could be addressed and valuable to the ecosystem, leadership teams can dedicate greater their research resources or encourage other entities to make additional investments to fill gaps or strengthen groups or topics.

Finally, researchers or directors of laboratories with a particular expertise in a group of research topics, may assess how frequently papers are published in their domain. Where frequencies are high, the competition for resources is also highest. The frequency of publications in contiguous or adjacent domains could suggest directions for future collaboration with other labs, or expansion into domains that are currently under studied.
