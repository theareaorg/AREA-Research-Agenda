Research agendas differ widely in their methodologies, target audiences, scope, depth and the length of time they seek to address or influence.

This section compiles research agendas, related tools and resources identified in the preparation of this resource. They are included to offer perspectives and insights for those developing policies which will impact AR and funding AR research.

2021 April: Ecorys partnered with the XR Association and released the https://xreuropepotential.com/assets/pdf/ecorys-xr-2021-report.pdf[XR in Europe 2021 Report] which includes an assessment of XR developments by region of Europe. It also highlights gaps and areas in need of greater investment.

=== Grand Challenges
In Mark Billinghursts' March 2021 article in Frontiers for VR, "Grand Challenges for Augmented Reality" https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frvir.2021.578080/full The DOI is https://doi.org/10.3389/frvir.2021.578080

He identifies the following areas as having high need for deeper research:

. Fundamental Display Technology
. Human, Information and Machine Interactions
. Tracking Technologies
. Perception and Neuroscience of AR
. Using AR for Collaboration
. Social and Ethical Aspects of AR Adoption.

Billinghurst concludes that in order to reach its full potential as a transformative technology, the above areas will need to receive far greater resources and attention.
