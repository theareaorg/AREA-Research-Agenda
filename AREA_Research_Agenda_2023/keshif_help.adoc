An interactive dashboard generated by the Keshif platform permits visitors to the site to explore topics in the enterprise AR Research Agenda. A user chooses one or more categories and keywords. The platform dynamically populates the middle column of the dashboard with the names of the research topics in order of their similarity to published literature compiled in the http://theAREA.org/findar/[FindAR database]. The titles of topics are hyperlinks to dedicated pages where the user can read a detailed topic description.

For help in interacting with the Keshif dashboard, refer to the https://help.keshif.me/[Keshif Knowledge Base].  The two most relevant sections of the Keshif Knowledge Base for the Keshif dashboard of the AREA Research Agenda research topics are its https://help.keshif.me/category/246-introduction[Introduction] and its https://help.keshif.me/category/192-record-group-selections-highlight-filter-compare[Selecting Data Groups: Highlighting, Comparing, Filtering] section.
