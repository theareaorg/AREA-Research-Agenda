=== Research Agenda Preparation
The analyses described in the previous section produced a ranking of the groups of topics in each of seven categories. Topics in the lowest frequency groups were examined and some were designated as having high relevance to enterprise AR adoption.

== AREA Member Topics
Since January 2017 AREA members have responded to nine calls for research project topics. The topics submitted were reviewed and some of those were captured as inputs for this research agenda. In addition, AREA members were involved in the validation of the first forty topics.

In parallel with the publication of this research agenda, members are solicited to complete a simple Web form with additional research topics. During conference calls among AREA members, additional topics or inputs are continually identified.

Other potential topics of importance:
. AR and 5G, Edge-computing
. How and when will AR Cloud technology impact enterprise AR?
. How and when can we expect interoperability between AR components and technologies?
. Preferred Enterprise licensing / business model for AR/VR SW Platform solution
. AR Cloud (focused on Enterprise use cases like warehouse navigation, safety, equipment planning, etc.) using reality capture / LIDAR services
. Monocular adoption/use cases vs. stereo or binocular adoption/use cases
. AR “smart viewer” (like what Qualcomm announced at MWC2019) use cases and interest level

Topics proposed by Bill (NIST)

. Companion Specifications of Data Standards for AR (or something similar). The main idea would be understanding which existing PLM-related data standards (STEP, MTConnect, QIF) comply well with AR software. This is very similar to the IoT idea, but more focused on the product-process-inspection pipeline.
. Curation/exchange representations of virtual models for AR that are technology agnostic. We have an on-going research collaboration about producing a new exchange data format that includes machine kinematics (for example) and other asset data to make the AR scene more ready and meaningful after import. Understanding the minimal information model around this idea would help drive this work.
