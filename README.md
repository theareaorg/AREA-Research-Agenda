# AREA Research Agenda

## Purpose

This repository provided the 8th AREA-directed Research Project team the space in which to create the processes and guidelines for AREA Research Agenda development, validation and publication. The [AREA Research Agenda 2021 folder](https://github.com/cperey/AREA-Research-Agenda/tree/main/AREA_Research_Agenda_2021), contains the content which was used for the first edition released in August 2021.

We are presently updating the Research Agenda. The maintenance project requires updating the data set used in conjunction with Natural Language Processing to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles published since June 2021. The analyses of the complete data set will form the basis for evaluating which research topics have received sufficient attention since original publication of the research agenda to remove them as topics. In addition, it will be used to identify new research topics that could be studied for maximum beneficial impacts on the development of the enterprise AR industry.

If you wish to make contributions to the AREA Research Agenda or offer feedback, please create issues.
